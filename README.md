Hello everyone! This is a website assets created by developers and just for developers. Now in building progress, but it will a good place for developers.

## What is the ProJetpack doing?
We created two important part to our website, just for developers.

### **Publishing *projects***
First part of our website is publishing projects. If you have an account, you can publish your project (or open-source code) into the website. The visiters can see your project and they can download (if it is setted by uploader), see a preview and can see codes (if it is setted by uploader, too)!

### **Sending *project* ideas**
Second part of our website is giving ideas. If you have a project on your mind but you don't want to make it or need partnership, you can publish these ideas. With this, developers can have idea and there is more project that everyone can access.
